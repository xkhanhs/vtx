// KeyboardLayoutOverride.swift
// Pins the physical-key → character mapping VietTelex composes on, so Telex types the
// same way no matter which input source the user switched FROM.
//
// THE PROBLEM: an IMKit input method owns no keyboard layout. macOS keeps whichever
// ASCII layout was selected before the switch and translates key events with it, so
// the SAME input method composes on a different keyboard depending on switch history.
// Measured 2026-08-13 with TISCopyCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSource:
//
//     ABC     → VietTelex   ⇒ current layout = com.apple.keylayout.ABC
//     Colemak → VietTelex   ⇒ current layout = com.apple.keylayout.Colemak
//
// For someone learning Colemak that is not a preference — it is a coin flip decided
// by where they happened to be a moment earlier.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT WORK: TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride, which reads like
// Apple's mechanism for exactly this. On macOS 26 it is INERT. It returns noErr, and
// then macOS discards the value — measured from inside the input-method process, at
// activateServer, with the app selected (2026-08-13):
//
//     layout-override com.apple.keylayout.ABC: ok stored=(none) live=…Colemak
//
// `stored` is TISCopyInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride read back immediately after
// the successful set. Nothing was kept, and `live` went on mirroring whichever
// source the user switched in from. Do not "restore" this call: noErr from it means
// nothing, so any future change here needs the same stored/live readback as proof.
//
// ALSO DOES NOT WORK: a selection BOUNCE — select the wanted layout, then re-select
// ourselves, automating the workaround users find by hand ("switch to ABC, type a
// bit, switch back"). Both selections return noErr and the layout does not move
// (2026-08-13):
//
//     layout-override …ABC: bounce …Colemak→…Colemak (0,0)
//
// Presumably macOS restores the layout an input method was last entered with, so
// leaving and re-entering reinstates the very binding we were trying to replace.
//
// WHAT WORKS: doing the mapping ourselves. KeyboardLayoutTranslator turns keyCode
// into the character the PINNED layout would produce, and the controller feeds the
// engine that instead of event.characters.
//
// The cost is that macOS's own translation is now wrong wherever we let a key pass
// through untouched, so the controller must insert those characters itself. That
// risk is fenced: `translator` is nil — and every path behaves exactly as it did in
// 1.5.7 — unless the user pinned a layout AND macOS is currently on a different one.
// The remapping path can therefore only run in the situation that is already broken.
//
// MAIN THREAD ONLY: `resolved` is an unsynchronized cache. Both call sites
// (activateServer, Settings) are main-thread; keep it that way.
