// KeyboardLayoutTranslator.swift
// Physical key → character, through a keyboard layout WE choose rather than the one
// macOS happens to have bound to the input method.
//
// Needed because macOS gives an input method no say in its own layout: see
// KeyboardLayoutOverride for the measurements that ruled out both documented routes
// (TISSetInputMethodKeyboardLayoutOverride is inert; a selection bounce is ignored).
// Translating the keycode ourselves is the only mechanism left that does not depend
// on the OS cooperating.
//
// PRECOMPUTED, because this sits on the keystroke path. UCKeyTranslate itself is not
// free (it walks the layout's tables and can allocate), and the engine budget is
// ~0.15 µs/key. So the whole layout is resolved ONCE when the user picks it — 128
// keycodes × {plain, shift} — into a flat array the hot path indexes. Building the
// table costs a few hundred UCKeyTranslate calls at settings-change time, which is
// free at that cadence.
//
// ASCII ONLY. A Telex key must be a bare Latin letter, digit or punctuation mark;
// anything a layout produces outside that (dead keys, accented output, multi-char
// sequences) is stored as nil and the caller falls back to the OS's own characters.
// That keeps exotic layouts from silently mangling input instead of degrading to
// today's behaviour.
