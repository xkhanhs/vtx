// TerminalTap.swift
// Terminal (tap) mode: apps that ignore insertText replacementRange (iTerm,
// Terminal.app…) can't be edited in place, and marked-text holds each keystroke in
// a composition buffer so the shell never sees partial input — autocomplete /
// zsh-autosuggestions die. Worse, such apps also don't honor IMKit's return-true
// suppression without a marked-text op, so an input method literally cannot stop the
// raw key.
//
// So for terminals we bypass IMKit entirely: a CGEventTap
// intercepts the physical key BEFORE the terminal sees it, and we either let it
// through (plain letters — shell sees them live, autocomplete works) or SUPPRESS it
// (return nil) and synthesize real Backspace + Unicode to apply a tone edit. Needs
// Accessibility to create the tap and post events, so it only runs on the
// non-sandboxed Developer ID build; the sandboxed Mac App Store build can't get the
// permission and terminals fall back to marked text.
//
// Re-entrancy: events we post travel back through the same tap and the IME. They are
// stamped via the event SOURCE's userData (kCGEventSourceUserData) — the per-event
// field does NOT survive posting; the source's value does — and passed straight
// through so they never re-drive the engine (that was a 9× Backspace cascade bug).
