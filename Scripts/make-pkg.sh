# make-pkg.sh — wrap the notarized VTX.app into a distributable .pkg
# installer that copies it to ~/Library/Input Methods and (in the user's GUI
# session) registers the input source + opens Keyboard settings, so the user
# never hand-copies into a hidden folder and doesn't need to log out.
#
# Prereqs:
#   1. Run Scripts/notarize-install.sh first — the app itself must be notarized
#      + STAPLED (an input method only registers if its own bundle is notarized;
#      the pkg's notarization does not staple a ticket onto the app inside).
#   2. To DISTRIBUTE, a "Developer ID Installer" certificate is required (you
#      currently have only "Developer ID Application"). Create it free at
#      developer.apple.com → Certificates → Developer ID Installer, download +
#      double-click to add to the keychain. Without it this script still builds
#      an UNSIGNED pkg you can test locally (right-click → Open, or
#      `installer -pkg … -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory`).
