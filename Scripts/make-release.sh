# make-release.sh — produce the two distributable artifacts for a GitHub release:
#   VTX-<VER>.app.zip   ← what a Homebrew cask would download (artifact stanza)
#   VTX-<VER>.pkg       ← direct-download installer (registers input source)
#
# The .app.zip is zipped from the NOTARIZED + STAPLED app so the ticket travels
# inside it (Gatekeeper works offline; an input method only registers when its
# bundle is stapled). notarize-install.sh's own zip is made BEFORE stapling (for
# the notary submit) — that one is NOT distributable, which is why this exists.
#
# Prereq: run Scripts/notarize-install.sh first (builds → signs → notarizes →
# staples the app at the derived path below). Re-run it if the app changed.
#
# Usage: Scripts/make-release.sh [OUTDIR]     (default OUTDIR = <repo>/build)

# TCC GUARD: the Accessibility grant is stored against the app's Designated
# Requirement. As long as the DR stays identity-based (bundle id + team OU) a re-signed
# update keeps the grant; if a release ever ships a DR that pins a cdhash or a specific
# leaf certificate, every existing grant silently turns into the "listed but refused"
# state on users' machines (espanso hit exactly this on a cert change). Cheap to check,
# impossible to notice by hand — so the release refuses to build if the DR drifts.
