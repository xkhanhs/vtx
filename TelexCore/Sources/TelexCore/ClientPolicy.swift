// ClientPolicy.swift
// Pure, testable classification of client apps by bundle identifier.
//
// Remote-desktop / virtualization / screen-sharing apps forward raw scancodes to a
// guest OS; a synthesized Unicode syllable is meaningless there and comes out wrong.
// For those clients the IME must behave exactly as if it were OFF.
//
// Browser-hosted viewers (Chrome Remote Desktop at remotedesktop.google.com) are the
// same class but share the browser's bundle id, so they are matched by URL / hosted
// app-id rather than by `com.google.Chrome` itself — composing in the rest of Chrome
// must keep working.
