// EnglishContextWords.swift — curated set of common English words used ONLY by the
// experimental context-based decision (engine.contextualEnglish). This is SEPARATE
// from EnglishCollisions (which force-restores Telex-colliding words regardless of
// context): this set answers "was the previous word English?" and "is this ambiguous
// word a plausible English word?" so that after an English word, an ambiguous next
// word (composed is valid Vietnamese but the raw keys spell an English word) is
// restored to English — "he is" → "he is" (not "he í"), while "sao í" stays Vietnamese.
//
// Deliberately weighted toward function words (pronouns, auxiliaries, articles,
// prepositions, conjunctions) plus the highest-frequency content words — enough to
// carry English context through a sentence. Curated by hand (not gen-english): most of
// these do NOT collide with Telex, so they never appear in EnglishCollisions, yet they
// are exactly the words that establish an English run. Lowercase, ascii.
//
// FORMAT: các bảng là literal nhiều dòng (từ cách nhau bởi space/newline), split lazily
// ở lần tra đầu tiên — thay cho ~450 phần tử literal, tiết kiệm hàng chục KB
// __TEXT/__DATA. Cùng kiểu với SyllableValidator.rimes. Sửa tay bình thường: chỉ cần
// thêm/bớt từ trong literal, dấu phẩy và dấu ngoặc kép không còn cần thiết.
