// TelexEngine.swift
// Simple Telex (strict). Hot path works over fixed-capacity (32) buffers.
//
// Strategy: keep the raw keystroke buffer (letters only) plus an INCREMENTAL parse
// state: each new key is folded into the persistent (letters + tone) state by one
// `parseStep` — the word is no longer re-parsed from scratch per key. Rendering
// copies the letters into a scratch, applies the post-passes (ươ propagation, tone
// placement) on the copy, and diffs against the previous render to yield the
// minimal (backspaces, insert) edit for the input client. Backspace and mid-word
// setting changes fall back to a full rebuild (replay of parseSteps) — identical
// semantics, since the parse is a left-to-right fold over the raw keys.
//
// Note: fixed-capacity `[UInt8]`/`[UInt32]` buffers are pre-reserved (capacity 32)
// and mutated in place — including the render/parse scratch buffers, which live on
// the instance so the hot path allocates nothing per keystroke (the live
// spell-check runs on a flat trie, not Strings). InlineArray would give a stronger
// zero-heap guarantee but requires macOS 26; reserved arrays keep the macOS 14
// deployment target.
